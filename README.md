# havissIoT

This project is just for fun and for learning more about IoT. 

Plan:
- Connect different devices (on different platforms) together using the internet and MQTT.
- Create a server application to analyze the data coming from the devices and perform actions based on these data
- Store the most valuable data in a database
- Access the data from other devices and/or a web page.


Other information:
- Im not planning to create my own MQTT broker. The "server" side of the project is just an application for analyzing the data. 
- I have very limited programming experience. So please dont be to harsh when my code is bad.. :)
